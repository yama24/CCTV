# Android to PC Remote Camera Switching - Testing Guide

## üîß Fixed Issues

The "Failed to switch video device" error when switching camera devices from PC to Android has been resolved with the following improvements:

### Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Better Mobile Device Constraints**
   - Changed from `exact` to `ideal` deviceId constraints for better mobile compatibility
   - Added proper resolution and frame rate limits for mobile devices
   - Improved constraint building logic

2. **Enhanced Device Validation**
   - Validates that requested device actually exists before switching
   - Better error messages for device-specific issues
   - Proper device enumeration for mobile devices

3. **Improved Track Replacement**
   - More robust track replacement in peer connections
   - Better error handling during track switching
   - Proper cleanup of old tracks

4. **Mobile-Specific Optimizations**
   - Better device organization (back camera first, then front)
   - Mobile camera labeling with helpful indicators
   - Device change listeners for plug/unplug events

## üì± Testing Steps

### Setup:
1. **Android Device**: Open camera page, start streaming
2. **PC/Desktop**: Open viewer page, connect to Android camera
3. **From PC**: Use device switching controls to change Android camera

### Expected Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Should see available cameras (Back üì∑, Front ü§≥, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Switching should work smoothly without errors
- ‚úÖ Video feed should update to new camera view
- ‚úÖ Success message should appear on both devices

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If switching still fails:

#### 1. Check Android Device Logs
```javascript
// Open Chrome Dev Tools on Android
// Look for console messages like:
"Switching video device to: [deviceId]"
"Target device found: [device label]"
"Device switch completed"
```

#### 2. Verify Available Devices
The camera should log available devices:
```javascript
"Available video devices: [{id: '...', label: 'Back Camera'}, ...]"
```

#### 3. Common Error Solutions

**"Device not found or not available"**
- Device may have disconnected
- Refresh the camera page on Android
- Check camera permissions

**"Device busy or unavailable"** 
- Another app is using the camera
- Close other camera apps on Android
- Restart the browser

**"Permission denied"**
- Camera permissions were revoked
- Grant permissions again in browser settings

**"Device constraints not supported"**
- The requested camera settings aren't supported
- Try switching to a different camera first

## üîç Debug Information

### On Android Device (Camera):
```javascript
// Check current devices
console.log('Current devices:', this.currentDevices);

// Check available devices
console.log('Available video devices:', this.availableDevices.video);

// Monitor switching process
"Remote device switch requested: video to [deviceId]"
"Switching to video device: [device label]"
"Device switch completed. Requested: [id], Actual: [actualId]"
```

### On PC (Viewer):
```javascript
// Check device switching requests
"Requesting device switch: video to [deviceId]"
"Device switch result: success/failure"
```

## üìã Test Checklist

- [ ] Android camera starts successfully
- [ ] PC viewer connects to Android camera
- [ ] PC shows Android's available cameras in dropdown
- [ ] Can switch between back and front cameras
- [ ] Video feed updates correctly after switch
- [ ] No "Failed to switch video device" errors
- [ ] Both devices show success messages
- [ ] Camera switching works in both directions

## üéØ Improved Features

### Better Mobile Support:
- **Camera Organization**: Back camera listed first, then front
- **Visual Indicators**: üì∑ (Rear), ü§≥ (Front) labels
- **Device Validation**: Ensures target device exists before switching
- **Error Specificity**: Clear error messages for different failure types

### Enhanced Logging:
- Detailed console logs for debugging
- Device enumeration information
- Track replacement status
- Constraint validation results

### Robust Error Handling:
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported devices
- Specific error messages for mobile issues
- Proper cleanup on switching failures
- Better user feedback

The remote camera switching from PC to Android should now work smoothly without the "Failed to switch video device" error! üéâ
