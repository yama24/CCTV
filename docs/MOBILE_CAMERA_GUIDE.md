## üì± Mobile Setup Instructions

### For Android Chrome Users:

2. **Enable Camera Permissions**
   - When prompted, click "Allow" for camera access
   - If denied, go to Settings ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Camera to re-enable

3. **Chrome Flags (for local development)**
   ```
   chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure
   ```
   - Add your local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3000`)
   - Restart Chrome after enabling

### Common Error Solutions:

#### "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getUserMedia')"
**Fixed!** The system now:
- Checks for `navigator.mediaDevices` support
- Provides fallback for older browsers
- Shows clear error messages with solutions

#### "NotAllowedError"
- Camera access was denied
- Allow camera permissions in browser settings
- Refresh the page and try again

#### "NotFoundError"
